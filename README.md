## Moody

This is a project on **PMD (Programming for Mobile Devices)** which consists of creating an app for Android phones.\
The chosen theme for this project was an app that measures the level of **happiness, rest, etc. (more to come if needed)**, on a daily basis.\
The end-users would be able to see a progress report with the last few days as an evolution of their **mood** (that's where the name comes from).\
The aim of this project is understanding the architecture of Android development and learning new technologies along the way.\
